      <h1>To Do What You Love Quit What You Don't</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I wanted to make a promise to myself, something by which to guide myself as I embark upon this adventure: if it stops being fun, quit.</p>
      <p>A lot of people will certainly misunderstand that, and really, I think their reaction might even be appropriate for a statement like that, but allow me to explain my meaning.</p>
      <p>I don't mean, "when the going gets tough, quit" nor do I mean that I'll quit the second something unpleasant happens, I mean: if you don't love what you're doing, quit.</p>
      <p>That philosophy has always served me well.</p>
      <p>After college, my parents stressed over what I might do while I did some travelling and worked part time jobs. I was being too picky, I didn't need to find the thing I would be doing the rest of my life, "It wasn’t important to love my vocation, as long as it enabled my avocation," my father would say, over and over.</p>
      <p>A year after graduating from Maryland, I started grad school and after one semester knew I was going to drop out. I stayed on for the full year because I didn't want to stress my family by dropping out after just one semester. I knew what they thought, what else could they be thinking?</p>
      <p>But, I knew better.</p>
      <p>I kept looking for what I loved, attempting to "follow my bliss" in the words of the eminent Joseph Campbell and found myself becoming a hacker. Nearly a year later, I couldn't be happier.</p>
      <p>I don't hack because it can make me rich, I hack because it makes me happy. I hack because I love it.</p>
      <p>Sure, I hope to make enough money so I can have the freedom of time to learn the piano or spend a southern summer climbing in Chile, to choose the projects I work on; but I love this right now.</p>
    <p>I've had friends refer to frat initiation as the most fun they'd never want to have again. I think maybe life is like that right now. I'm broke, unemployed, and my car is falling apart. I've got a busted window with the Vermont winter on its way and my muffler is hanging on by a coat hanger and not even connected to the rest of my exhaust while the passenger door doesn’t open from the outside. I've got credit card bills piling up and cash is running out. But I love life. I love waking up every day and getting to hack. Getting to transform an idea into something that will change people's lives. Somebody might meet someone they fall in love with at a concert they wind up at because of the site I've built.</p>
    <p>I love telling people about Gigsmash when they ask what I do. I love the look in their eyes when they realize how happy I am, how surprising and wonderful it is to them. Things won't always be rainbows and sunshine, but that's just a part of the ride. But if it ever ceases to be a source of love, of passion, if it becomes a burden, I'll quit.</p>
    <p>I think quitting takes more bravery than staying sometimes. Sometimes, staying is the easy choice. Sucking it up and playing your part is what's expected, so to break from expectation is to make some waves. But that's what it takes to be happy, that's what it takes to do what you love.</p>
